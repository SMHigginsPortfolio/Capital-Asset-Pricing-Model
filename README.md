# Finance-equations - I am very new to coding in C++ (and coding in general to be honest), but thought that I would try to develop my skills in coding as it something that interested for quite some time now.
I also have a keen intest in finance which I am also trying to learn on the side whilst I complete a degree in a completely unrelated topic. 
I am aware that C++ is seen as one of teh harder languages to learn but I like the challenge. 
I have decided that using github will be a good way to both record my progress and also hopefully have some feedback to help me make my code as clean as possible, for it to work as fast and efficiently as it possibly can.
To start I intend to learn how to write code for financial equations individualy (starting with CAPM), and when I get good enough, starting look at merging them together to create a more purposeful project.
Ideally, (in a few years) I'd like to use c++ to automate my own stock trading.
It's going to be a long journey but I looking forward to the ride.
